# Create Training Data Set Examples
This repository contains example code and configuration files to create training data sets from annotated Whlole Slide Imaging using Simagis Live Image Acess API

## Overview
Using These examples you can quickly create training data sets for machine learning algorithms from annotated whole slide images, from any slide format (vendor) 

In these examples a Java utility program is using configuration file in JavaScript to access Simagis Live server via Image Access API and exatract image tiles from annotated areas on whole slide images.
